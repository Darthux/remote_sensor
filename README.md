# remote_sensor
Using a Raspberry Pi (I'm using 2B), Thermistor, SixFab's 3G/4G-LTE Base HAT, Quectel EC25 and Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2. 
This project captures time lapse photos, overlays DATETIME and Temperature on top of photographs and logs readings 
into CSV file. Completely remote over cellular connection with reverse VNC and reverse SSH connections initiated by 
SMS commands.
